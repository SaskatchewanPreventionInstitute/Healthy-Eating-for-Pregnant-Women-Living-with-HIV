The effects of folic acid are most significant during the first few weeks of pregnancy.

The recommended BMI range for a woman is between 18.5 and 24.9. A pregnant woman with a BMI that is less than 18.5 should expect to gain 12.5 to 18 kg (28 to 40 lb), and a woman with a BMI of more than 25 to 29.9 should expect to gain 7 to 11.5 kg (15 to 25 lb). If a pregnant woman’s BMI is over 30, it is important for her to talk to a healthcare provider about how much weight she should gain.   In other words, women with a lower BMI should gain more weight, and women with a higher BMI should gain less with a physician’s guidance. Healthy weight gain during pregnancy is associated with a lower risk of complications during pregnancy and labour and a reduced risk of having a low birth weight infant. To calculate a pre-pregnancy BMI, visit the link on the next slide.
